# EBDR
Eigenvalue-Based Block Diagonal Representation and Application to p-Nearest Neighbor Graphs (EBDR)

We proposed EBDR, an unsupervised block diagonal representation method that uses the eigenvalues of a block diagonal affinity matrix, to deduce 
the sparsity level. Therefore, we first analyze the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix based on an ideal block diagonal model (Theorem 1). Then, 
a key idea is to define a vector that represents the blocks as a piece-wise linear function (Corollary 1.1). This enables a graph construction 
algorithm building upon the piece-wise linear function that estimates the parameters of the unknown target eigenvalue vector. The proposed 
eigenvalues-based block diagonal representation (EBDR) method is applied to p-nearest neighbor graph construction.
